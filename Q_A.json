{
  "answers": [
    "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly, while 'force' is described as a power of resisting, which every body uses to maintain its state of rest or uniform motion.",
    "Newton's three laws of motion are: 1) A body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force, 2) The change in motion is proportional to the applied force, and 3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary orbits and gravitational forces.",
    "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by demonstrating that the force retaining a planet in its orbit is always directed towards the sun, leading to the conclusion that areas described by a radius from the sun are proportional to the times, as shown in the document.",
    "Newton demonstrates that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses by showing that the force of gravity towards a planet arises from the forces towards all its parts, each in reciprocal proportion to the square of the distance. He verified this principle through the motions of celestial bodies and Kepler's laws.",
    "Newton argues that gravitational force acts universally on all masses because every particle has a gravitating power, and in spherical masses, this force operates as if confined to their centers, affecting all bodies proportionally to their mass and inversely to the square of the distance.",
    "Newton explains that planetary orbits are perturbed by mutual attractions, with the sun's gravitational force being the primary influence, while the interactions between planets and comets cause minor inequalities in their motions.",
    "Newton used his method of fluxions, a precursor to calculus, in Principia. He preferred the Geometrical Method over algebraic calculations, which is why he didn't use standard calculus notation.",
    "Newton explains orbital motion by stating that centripetal force, which he equates to gravity, retains celestial bodies in their orbits by drawing them towards a central body, such as the sun, and varies inversely with the square of the distance from the center. This force ensures planets move in conic sections, like ellipses, with the sun at one focus.",
    "Newton explains that motion in resisting media like air or fluids is affected by the resistance proportional to the motion excited by the projectile in the fluid, which acts to retard its motion. The resistance is related to the density of the fluid and the velocity of the projectile.",
    "Newton's notion of absolute space and time is independent and unchanging, unlike relative motion, which is based on external references and can vary. This distinction supports his laws by providing a consistent framework for understanding motion and forces, unaffected by relative perceptions.",
    "Isaac Newton's grandfather was Robert Newton.",
    "Beyond his grandfather, Robert Newton, Sir Isaac Newton's descent cannot be traced with certainty. Two family traditions suggest either Scotch extraction or origins from Newton in Lancashire."
