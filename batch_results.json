      "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the measure arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly. It is distinct from 'force,' which is the power of resisting or altering motion, as described in his definitions of innate force and laws of motion.",
      "Newton's three laws of motion are: 1) A body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force, 2) The change in motion is proportional to the applied force, and 3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In celestial mechanics, these laws explain planetary orbits and gravitational forces.",
      "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by demonstrating that the force retaining a planet in its orbit is directed towards the sun, leading to areas proportional to times, as the force varies inversely with the square of the distance from the sun.",
      "Newton demonstrates gravity's inverse square relationship by showing that the force of gravity between two bodies is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance between their centers, as derived from the motion of celestial bodies and Kepler's laws.",
      "Newton argues that gravitational force acts universally on all masses because every particle possesses a gravitating power, and in spherical masses, this force operates as if concentrated at their centers, affecting all bodies proportionally to their mass and inversely to the square of the distance.",
      "Newton explains that planetary orbits are perturbed by mutual attractions, with the sun's gravitational force being the primary influence, while the interactions between planets and comets cause minor inequalities in their motions.",
      "Newton used his method of fluxions, a precursor to calculus, in Principia. He preferred the Geometrical Method over algebraic calculations, which is why he didn't use standard calculus notation.",
      "Newton explains orbital motion by showing that centripetal force, which he equates to gravity, retains celestial bodies in their orbits by acting towards a central body, such as the sun, and varies inversely with the square of the distance from that body. This force ensures planets move in conic sections like ellipses.",
      "Newton explains that motion in resisting media like air or fluids is affected by the resistance proportional to the motion excited by the projectile in the fluid, which acts to retard its motion. The resistance is related to the density of the fluid and the velocity of the projectile.",
      "Newton's notion of absolute space and time is independent and unchanging, while relative motion is based on the position and movement of bodies relative to each other. This distinction supports his laws by providing a consistent framework for understanding motion unaffected by external factors.",
